# MyToken Solidity Contract
This Solidity smart contract represents a basic token named MyToken. It demonstrates fundamental concepts in creating Ethereum smart contracts using the Solidity programming language. The contract includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens, which are common actions in token-based blockchain systems.

# Description
The MyToken contract showcases the implementation of a basic token using Solidity. The contract defines a custom token named "FABIAN" with the symbol "FAB". It includes functions to mint new tokens and burn existing ones. Minting increases an address's token balance and the total supply, while burning reduces an address's balance and the overall supply. The contract serves as an educational starting point for understanding token management on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To interact with the MyToken contract, you can use Remix, an online Solidity development environment. Make sure you have a compatible web browser and an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask installed.

# Execution
Visit the Remix website: https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Create a new file named MyToken.sol.
Copy and paste the provided Solidity code from MyToken.sol into the Remix editor.
Compile the contract by selecting the appropriate compiler version (0.8.18) in the "Solidity Compiler" tab and clicking "Compile MyToken.sol".
Deploy the contract by navigating to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab and selecting the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu. Click "Deploy".
Interact with the contract functions:
Use the mint function to add tokens to an address.
Use the burn function to reduce tokens from an address.
Remember that this is a simplified example for educational purposes and might require test Ether on a test network like Ropsten.
